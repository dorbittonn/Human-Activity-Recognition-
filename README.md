# Human-Activity-Recognition-

HAR dataset is about 

This specific task is actually about predicting the human activity using only 6 features (measurements of sensors) of a patient:
-Body Accelerations in 3 axes
-Angular velocity in 3 axes (Measured by Gyro)

To handle this task I've used of LSTM vs KNN - one Deep learning model and another Classic ML model.
